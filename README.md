<h1 align="center">Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

My name is Bruno Scachetti *(he/they)*, I'm a Brazillian developer, with a passion for making interactive experiences.
I speak both Portuguese and English and I have a Bachelor's Degree in **System Analysis and Development** and another in **Game Development**.
I'm currently working on an webapp ERP system for a company, and I'm learning a lot of React, Next, Typescript and Javascript. I'd say it's a lot of work for a first big project, but it's being a very good learning experience.

### Skills and Tools âš¡
#### Web Development

</p>
I've been focusing on web development recently, working on a big project and several other small ones, all using Nextjs.

#### Game Development

I started with game development, and while I am comfortable using Unity, I've been learning Godot as well, as I see it as a tool with a lot of potential.

I'm working on a portfolio website too, so soon it'll be easier to see what I've been working on and what I can do.
